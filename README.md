# Data Analysis Assignment  

This repository contains my assignment for analyzing data with **Pandas** and visualizing results with **Matplotlib**.  

## Contents  
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.  

## Dataset  
- The notebook uses the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, so no external CSV is required.
